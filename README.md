# Simple Text Editor

A basic text editor implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description

The Simple Text Editor provides a minimalistic interface for users to input and edit text. It includes the following features:

- **Editing**: Users can click on the editor and start typing or edit existing text.

- **Local Storage**: The editor automatically saves the content to the browser's local storage, so users can continue editing where they left off even after closing the browser.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

2. The text editor will appear on the web page.

3. Click inside the editor to start typing or editing text.

4. Any changes made will be automatically saved to the browser's local storage.

## Customization

You can customize the text editor by modifying the CSS styles in the `<style>` section of the HTML file. For more advanced features, you can also enhance the JavaScript code to add functionalities like:

- Text formatting options (bold, italic, etc.).
- Saving and loading files from a server.
- Spell-checking or other text processing features.
